                        We also provide EVERY kind of tool needed to enjoy our routes, from binoculars to better observe

                        famous is the indri whose calls awaken weary travellers with a rush of excitement, other famous

                        Perhaps a little less known is the eerie aye aye, whose intriguing looks, including bulbous eye
                        and
                        a very long finger, led to much supernatural suspicion among the Malagasy people.
